## Colony Wars

Colony Wars is a time based strategy game that requires usage of a considerable amount of strategic thinking. Game map basically consists of 2 main bases for each player and several neutral bases that both players seeking to possess. The main purpose in the game is to get control of all the bases in the game. Every base produces number of soldiers by time passing. In order to get control of a base you need to have required amount of soldiers in it if it is a neutral base, if it is an enemy base though you need to send more soldiers than enemy soldiers that currently present in that base. The strategies become complicated as there exist varied nations in the game each of them having different advantages. Such as one having soldiers that move faster while another one having a faster production of soldiers etc. Also there are some special bases in the game that provide some advantages to its possessor which both of players will compete to get. One has to make his attacks in the right moment since sending troops from a particular base makes it weak to possible attacks while attacking more comes with the advantage of possessing more bases which comes with a greater production of soldiers. More or less Colony Wars is a strategy game that puts its basis on mass production of soldiers and well planned invasions.
